# etch-a-sketch

This is the JavaScript/jQuery project from [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com). Is is an etch-a-sketch website using JavaScript and jQuery.

The grid tiles change color when you hover over them. If you hover over a tile multiple times it will get darker until it is black.
The reset button at the top resets the grid and gives you the option to set the grid size.
